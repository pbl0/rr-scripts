# BetterIndexRR
An user script for Rival Regions game that filters out regions in the index ranking page. It will leave only the regions that show an index change, so you don't waste your precious time scrolling.

This script works both in PC and Mobile.

- **Mobile**: It will also add the missing link to the index ranking page when you click on the index number.

## Add your Regions

You can also add your own regions by adding their id to the `myregions` value. You can find any region id at the end of it's url.

Example: ``` ["15202", "4305", "4518"] ```
