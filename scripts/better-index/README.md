# BetterIndexRR

An user script for Rival Regions game that filters out regions in the index ranking page. It will leave only the regions that show an index change, so you don't waste your precious time scrolling.

This script works both in PC and Mobile.

- **Mobile**: ~~It will also add the missing link to the index ranking page when you click on the index number.~~ This is no longer needed as it was recently added to the base game by our beloved admin.

## Add your Regions

Go to any region page and click the `add region` button and it will appear highlighted on the list.
