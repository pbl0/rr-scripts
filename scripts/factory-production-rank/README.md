## Factory Production Ranking

This scripts calculates the production of the top level factory of each region in rivalregions.

### How to use

After installing it will work whenever you enter https://rivalregions.com/info/regions (Make sure to login on the game first otherwise it will show a blank page). Wait a few seconds for every region to load and the script will show a small menu.

Fill out with your level, work experience and current market price of the desired resource and it will calculate your production for the top level factory of each region.

The new columns added are **10E Prod**, **300E Prod** and **$**. Click on any column header to sort the table.

> **Notice:** This script doesn't take in consideration the Factory Salary%, Dept Bonuses%, Health index or pollution, so the real production might slightly differ.

> For now only oil, ore, uranium and diamonds are supported. Other resources might get added in the future.
